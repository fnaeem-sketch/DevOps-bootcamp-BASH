# ðŸš€ BASH Scripting Module  

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**  
This repository is dedicated to my **BASH Scripting Module**, where I document my learning and showcase **four scripts** demonstrating essential scripting skills.  

BASH scripting is a powerful tool for **automation, system administration, and DevOps workflows**. Through this module, I aim to enhance my ability to:  
- âœ… Automate repetitive tasks efficiently.  
- âœ… Work with **files, directories, and user input**.  
- âœ… Use **conditional statements** and **loops** to handle logic.  
- âœ… Apply **real-world scripting scenarios** in a DevOps environment.
